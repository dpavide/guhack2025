# Copy this file to .env in the same folder (backend/.env)
# Then fill in your Supabase project URL and Service Role Key
# NEVER commit the real .env to git

# Required (backend server-only)
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co
# Prefer Service Role key here so backend can insert/delete as needed
SUPABASE_KEY=YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Optional alternative names recognized by the backend loader
# SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL=
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# You may also have a .env at repo root; backend tries loading both root/.env and backend/.env
